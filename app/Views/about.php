        OpenTexts.World is an experimental service developed to provide free access to the digitised text collections of UK libraries. 
        Initiated during the COVID-19 lock down, it builds on the work of the 
        <a href="https://gddnetwork.arts.gla.ac.uk/index.php/about-us/" title="link to GDD Network">GDD Network</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        OpenTexts.World brings together, in a single search, the digitised collections of several major UK libraries. 
        A simple search interface, retrieves brief information about digitised books and other texts, and provides users with links to  resources.

        The service is based on research undertaken by the Global Digitised Data Network, an Anglo-American research collaboration, funded by the
