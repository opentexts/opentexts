        <h1>Accessibility statement for OpenTexts.World</h1>
        <p>
            We want everyone who visits the OpenTexts.World website to feel 
            welcome and find the experience rewarding, going above and beyond 
            the The Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations 2018.

        <h2>What are we doing?</h2> 
        <p>
            To help us make the OpenTexts.World website a positive place for 
            everyone, we've been using the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 
            (WCAG) 2.1. These guidelines explain how to make web content more 
            accessible for people with disabilities, and user friendly for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            The guidelines have three levels of accessibility (A, AA and AAA). 
            Weâ€™ve chosen Level AA as the target for the OpenTexts.World website.
        </p>

        <h2>How are we doing?</h2>
